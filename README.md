# ECG-diagnosis-by-Neural-Network
This repository is created in order to re-perform the stats of Ribeiro's article. The second objective is to predict on the PTB-XL dataset using transfer-learning with Ribeiro's Neural Network pre-trained architecture.  
Then, the only training takes place with 3 Dense Layers added to the Main Model. Those 3 new layers are trained on 20 000 ECG, using 18 000 for training and 2 000 for validating

## Requirements
This code was tested on `Python 3` with `Tensorflow 2.2`. There is an older branch (tensorflow-v1) that contain the code implementation for `Tensorflow 1.15`.  
You also need `wfdb` and `opencv` to process data from PTB-XL.  
You can install the dependencies directly by creating a conda environment.
``` 
conda env create -f ecg_env.yml
conda activate ecg_env
``` 
## New Model
The new model is watchable on this repos with the document `model.png`.     
Ribeiro's pre-trained model is available in: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3625017  
PTB-XL Dataset is available in: https://doi.org/10.13026/x4td-x982  
Finally, the big Ribeiro's dataset is available directly by contacting the `Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais`.
